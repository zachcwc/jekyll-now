# Past Week
Started Netflix project with my partner and we got most of it done in an hour. Went over some cool Python qualities like how it caches small primitive types, also went over some exception handling procedure.

# Experience of Class so Far
So far the class is pretty fun and easy. After working mainly with languages like c which expect you to do much of the work on your own, Python provides a vast number of abstractions that let you just focus on coding. I've already written more Python scripts to help me out than I have scripts in any other language, not that I had written that many; still, this class is the first time I've written in Python and I don't feel like I'm drowning in the language. It should be noted that having taken OOP just before this makes this class much much easier.

# What is in my way
Multicore Operating Systems is by far the hardest class I've ever had in my life and it is making every other class fifty times harder. First time I've ever had to pull an (almost) all nighter at UT. Super fun class though.

# What will you do next week
Finish Netflix, NOT go to the career fair (woohoo!), Trudy's martinis for Valentines.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
The first company you talk to at the career fair should not be your favorite company there. You'll (probably) be much more relaxed for every company after the first, you just have to get in the water slowly. Also remember your whole life is not contingent upon doing well at the career fair, so take a deep breath and you'll do fine.
