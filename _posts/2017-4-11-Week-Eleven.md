title: Week Eleven Software Engineering

# Past Week
Wrote a simulator for Advanced Architecture (Y-86 ring any bells?), moved, and finished the SWE project. In class we went over some more advanced SQL techniques.

# Experience of Class so Far
SWE is going well, I've heard the last project was the hardest one of the semester so I am excited to have that out of the way. Also, though it was annoying that we had to work right up until the deadline, I am very happy with what my group and I put out for our website. I am also pretty excited to work with the D3 library. I haven't really done much front end stuff, ever, so it will be nice to dip my toes into the waters of a nice library that does most of the work for me (at least that's what I think now, before I have started).

# What is in my way
Time and sleep as always. Also unstructured classes (not SWE).

# What will you do next week
Security project, Multicore project, Advanced Architecture homework, Art History Paper, SWE project, and I'm sure I'm forgetting one-hundred other things but c'est la vie.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Watch Rick and Morty.
