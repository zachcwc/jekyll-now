title: Week Three Software Engineering
---

# Past Week
Went over the fact that Python likes to use try catches. Went over Collatz solutions some more. Went over the different types of data structures that are provided by the java framework.

# What is in my way
Need to recheckout a previous git commit that had both meta cache and normal collatz calculation. I used Collatz calculation to make meta cache and was unsure if we needed to leave the calculation in as well, but we do.

# What will you do next week
Multicore and security projects, also start Netflix.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
It's super nice to stay busy but remember to do something fun every once in a while. Hiking is great, go to Turkey creek but bring a change of shoes or something because the water features are too nice to not get in.

# Appreciation
Light jackets.

# Note
Look up capability-based operating systems and weep.
