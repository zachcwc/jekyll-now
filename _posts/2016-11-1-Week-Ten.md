# Past Week
Worked on projects off and on. Learned about swap which seems pretty cool.

# What is in my way
When it rains it pours, it's already projects in every class time of the year. I'm beginning to agree more and more with people when they say college is 50% about learning time management because that's the only way the juggle and still do well in college. It's hard to put down a project you like that's due in a week and pick one up that's due in three hours that you haven't started because it's compilers and so boring that it hurts. Also, man is it getting harder and harder to go to my Compilers class.

# What will you do next week
Projects all day everyday, also reading A Tale of Two Cities. Also VOTE BECAUSE AMERICA. 

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Don't forget to keep all of your receipts during interviews, like all of your receipts. Like, parking is six dollars for four hours at a time in Seattle and you ain't gotta pay for that, so don't.

# Appreciation
We have approximately three weeks of nice (temperature) weather left so revel in it.

# Grievances
I don't see the romanticism, walking in the rain sucks.
