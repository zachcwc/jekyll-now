title: Week Thirteen Software Engineering
---

# Past Week
Went over the adapter pattern and the fact that if a child overrides a method in the parent they can have a different return type, provided the relationship between the two return types (the child's and parents) is the same type of relationship as that of the parent and child in SWE. Learned about Islamic art in art history which was pretty cool. Went hiking several times.

# Experience of Class so Far
Currently the class is amazing because it has wound down so much. The only things left besides the final test are the presentations and for the students that have no qualms with public speaking (like me), it will almost certainly be a breeze. Also, the material in class currently is my favorite, talking about design patterns and their ins and outs make me feel like an actual software engineer.

# What is in my way
Motivation has begin to ween, graduation is only two weeks away.

# What will you do next week
Present SWE project, finish last multicore project, finish last security project. Lots of "lasts" for college have begun yet and I am not yet nostalgic for them.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
One of the books Professor Downing said was good for design patterns was head first on amazon. I agree, the book is very interesting, the authors try to make the material as interesting as possible and include random jokes throughout the book which helps to provide the impetus needed to keep reading.
