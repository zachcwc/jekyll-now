# Class Overview
Overall this class was worth taking. I would highly recommend taking at least one Downing class before graduating UTCS mainly because of all the tools you learn that you wouldn't in any other class; they boost your resume quite a bit (I think). Things like knowing continuous delivery frameworks like Travis CI, and about containerization tools like Docker, can make your resume stand out from others. That being said, Downing is an excellent and enjoyable teacher so it's not like actually going to class is a giant downer or anything. Downing's Software engineering is certainly more challenging than his OOP class, but only if you have bad partners for the final project is it much much more challenging; I had great partners, so it was only slightly more challenging than OOP. The tests in SWE were much more challenging than those in OOP, but I think this was because he changed his test format from coding to multiple choice, and I do better on the former. If you do better on the latter then it will be fine.
