title: Week Ten Software Engineering

# Past Week
Mainly spent it writing an assembler for CS 350c. In class we went over more sql stuff and also some html precursor things. 

# Experience of Class so Far
The class is going pretty well. The group of people I am in has at least one person that supremely competent in every field of the project it seems, which is making it pretty easy (almost too easy). It's cool how when every person gets to focus on what they know best, stuff gets done relatively painlessly. We also had an Atlassian talk last week which was pretty cool. It was more interesting than the other talks because they went over actual an real-world problem they had and what methodologies they used to fix it; rather than just give a sales pitch of their company that's mainly buzzwords. It's nice to see the real-world problems they face because one of the most important things that I would want to know about a company is what I would actually do in the company, and examples of problems I might face are excellent ways to impart that knowledge.

# What is in my way
When there's motivation there isn't time, when there's time there isn't motivation.

# What will you do next week
Multicore project Advanced Architecture project, 439 Exam writing and proctoring, Advanced Architecture test, 439 Exam grading, SWE project, Security homework, moving into new apartment, sleep, in that order.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
If you want to give away the furniture you don't want, but don't have a truck to take it somewhere, Goodwill picks up your furniture for you if you schedule the pickup during the week! Also you can use it to write off some of your taxes!
