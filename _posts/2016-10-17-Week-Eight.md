# Past Week
Learned about how sloppily initializing arrays of objects by not using an allocator can waste time because all objects in the array will call their default constructor.
Have been in San Francisco and Seattle for interviews the rest of the week aka Thursday (oct 13) - Tuesday (oct 18).
Exploring a city in a day is impossible so I've just been doing homework in coffeeshops/parks and eating food.

# What is in my way
Can airports please have free wifi? I want to do my homework in the airport, but it's so so so easy to be like "well, no wifi so what's the point in working on this when I'll wan't to check piazza and look and documentation and etc. etc.". Also, planes that say "We have provided you with wifi :)!!!:D:p" and then when you try to access the wifi they "provided" it's wifi that you have to pay for. Like, technically you did provide wifi, but can you not imply that it's free wifi and disappoint me.

# What will you do next week
So many projects due this week so I know that I won't be sleeping.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Gayle's section in the front of "Cracking the Coding Interview" on what the companies look for, and what questions they ask during their interviews, is very very very accurate as pertains to Google and Microsoft.

# Appreciation
Not having to carry "Cracking the Coding Interview" around in by backpack for the next couple weeks #bless.
Weather that's NOT cold and rainy (lookin' atchu Seattle).
Terrible, terrible highly rated coffeeshops that have bad wifi, broken plugs, expensive everything, and somehow 4.7 stars on Yelp (bad San Francisco, bad).
Also, thanks interviews for making my whiteboard coding way more on point.

# Grievance
Those rainfall showerheads are weak af at the Bellevue Westin. Gravity ain't strong enough to create sufficient downward force in the span of a foot yo. BUT, it is aesthetically pleasing as all get out, so perhaps hashtag worth.

# Comic
Due to me not feeling like looking for a comic, there will be no comic this week. Reflect inwardly instead, ponder the mechanisms of your soul, regret your decision, get back to studying, repeat ad infinitum.
