title: Week Five Software Engineering

# Past Week
Worked on several projects due this week. Learned about comprehensions and closures in SWE. Turned in Netflix. Homemade chinese food on Valentines day instead of the career fair.

# Experience of Class so Far
Pretty much Python is great and ya know, I am definitely starting to become a believer; closures are incredibly cool. It's funny because we learn and use Python in SWE near-constantly, but in my Advanced Architecture class I hear about how inefficient so many high-level languages are. I agree, one probably shouldn't use Python to matrix multiply huge matrices (really though, don't), but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have a ton of other uses. Not all programs need to run at the speed of light, sometimes ease of use and easily understandable code is more important.

# What is in my way
Multicore is still incredibly hard. OS test this week which means I'll be spending 4 hours in Review session, 4 proctoring, and many more grading. Advanced Architecture test Tuesday. So many projects, so little time.

# What will you do next week
Not sleep is pretty much the only surety. During the waking hours, mostly OS (both multi- and single- core) and Architecture stuff.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Every once in a while take some deep breaths.
