# Past Week
This week we learned a lot more about constructors, that was very interesting/confusing.

# What is in my way
Grading 439 tests was very much in my way last week, but now I have assigned Fs to everyone (kidding, kidding) and now what is mainly in my way is this upcoming OOP test. There seems to be so much subject matter just because of all the combinations that can be made with the subject matter to create more subject matter and more complex questions on the test. The hilariously unforseen (but not really) zero I got on the quiz this week (you know which one) indicates that this test could very well be a doozy.

# What will you do next week
Test preparation, pretend Halloween is closer, enjoy the ~month of decent weather we will get until it's cold. Oooh also Google drops their next phone on Tuesday.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Take a deep breath.

# Appreciation
* Light jackets *

# Grievances
1.	My roommate's dog always looks like he's crying even when he's happy and it's bumming me out.
2.	The necessary willpower to write this post this week was immense and not forthcoming.

# Note
You should totally go to a haunted house.
