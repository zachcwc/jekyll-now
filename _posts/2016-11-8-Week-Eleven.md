# Past Week
Learned about the new Life project, finished Darwin project, signed with Microsoft. 

# What is in my way
Strangely enough, doing my homework is getting in the way of doing my homework. I am finding more and more time for reading A Tale of Two Cities for English Lit in lieu of doing work in my computer science classes. This seems problematic because I have a compilers project due Friday and haven't looked at it, while I am mostly through this book which we don't have to finish until next week.

# What will you do next week
Project due in Mobile Computing, it's an entire app for android. Guess I should start. Oh and also a project due in compilers over (presumably?) compiling new things? Not sure, haven't looked at it.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
If you have to drive to school like myself and also hate traffic like myself, you should leave earlier. I know the idea of waking up earlier and losing that precious sleep sounds blasphemous, but if it saves you forty-five minutes of traffic then you'll definitely thank yourself. In some situations even leaving ten or fifteen minutes earlier can cut your travel timein half and is completely worth it.

# Appreciation
Not feeling compulsory need to troll people on CS Facebook page.

# Grievances
Feeling the need to follow the flamewars on the CS Facebook page.
