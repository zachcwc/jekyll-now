# Past Week
Learned a lot about c++ syntax and tips to make it run faster (++ in front because lvalue, rvalue differences necessitate copies in certain instances). Talked more thoroughly abou the first project due (Collatz), especially tips on how to optimize it. We also discussed how to use some of the tools in the class better. Downing made a nifty little checklist for us in class for the first project. We also talked about testing and how to do it properly (including such things on why not to use Asserts; long story short don't shoot your lover, throw stuff at them instead).

# What is in my way
Well, what WAS in my way was Docker, but 32,426,329,058 hours later one realizes that the directory you start in in Docker and the directory you want to be in are different (by two letters). Now what's in my way is the syntax of C++, of which I know very litte. Sytax is syntax though so I'm not terribly worried.   

# What will you do next week
Definitely planning on finishing the Collatz project by Monday, but that's all I have concretely planned thus far.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
First off, Travis CI is so cool. I've used another CI tool before (Jenkins), but Travis seems so much easier to use (so far) and CI in general is a very good idea so A+ Travis, A+.

# Musings
Can an issue in github be not having the not having the higher creative function to find enough issues in your project to meet a minimum issue requirement?

# Storytime
As an aside I have a funny (probably well known) history lesson. So apparently the default permissions in linux are set for everything to be readable. As you may know the UTCS computers share a distributed kind of file system. So, if default permissions are left, then to see another Users FS one needs only cd into it. Obviously, the easy fix to this is to change permissions, but an entering CS student may not know this, and even a wizened one might assume that permissions are already properly set to ensure privacy for themselves. ALACK, such was not the case until two years ago, so laid bare was the cs directory of almost everyone for quite some time. Long story short, if anyone ever saw my awful 312 code I'm so so sorry.
