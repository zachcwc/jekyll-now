# Past Week
Finished up the Netfilx project. Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the project was configuring paths, makefiles, setting compiler flags, and beating Travis CI into submission (I love you Travis CI). Three projects total and one test made for a challenging week, but made the weekend all the sweeter. Also a very very cool talk by a *kind of* literal rocket scientist in class and template functions.

# What is in my way
Scheduling conflicts are the bane of life. There are only so many hours in a day (24 I think), and without Google Calendar to hold my hand through them I would surely be lost.

# What will you do next week
There's totally a test next week isn't there? That then.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
The best times to go to Gregory Gym (best in this case denoting the fewest people) are before 10 AM or between like 1 and 3 PM.

# Appreciation
Russian house on fifth is amazing if you like complimentary vodka shots (Nastrovia!!), Ukranian Borscht, red meats, and then more vodka shots (not complimentary but very worth).

# Grievances
I've heard the new Google Phones (Pixel) will not be waterproof. C'mon Googs, help us people that spill perpetually out. Will be #disappoint if I waited this long only for that to be a nonfeature.

# Comic
This is a [comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-12-01 "This text don't need no title").
