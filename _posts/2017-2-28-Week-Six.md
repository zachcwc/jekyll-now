title: Week Six Software Engineering

# Past Week
Worked on multicore all day, the all night, then all day, then all night. And then we didn't finish. Grading the 439 tests for hours was also a joy. Also I wrote my first alias because I am a pro #hacker and not because I was too lazy to ever do it before.

# Experience of Class so Far
It was cool to learn more comprehension knowledge stuff, learning about using yield to create a generator, and learning to create containers to hold datasets. We'll see how everyone feels about the class after the test I suppose.

# What is in my way
Multicore always. Right now advanced architecture is actually pretty challenging. And then of course there's that SWE test coming up. Also, I totally messed up my knee when I was squatting so no more leg day for a while.

# What will you do next week
SWE test is on Thursday, which means Mardi Gras on Tuesday is canceled. Need to catch up on Multicore since every project builds on everything. Also need to grade project 1 for 439, but thank god for scripts.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
There's this awesome website called apartment list I have been using to find apartments in Seattle. I hate to sound like a salesman but holy God their UI is gorgeous and it's honestly a joy to browse the site. Especially with the heinous mess that is most other apartment finding sites.
