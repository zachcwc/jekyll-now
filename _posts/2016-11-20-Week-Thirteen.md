# Past Week
Finished turning in the last project in OOP, now to study for the final that supposedly everyone fails. Learned more about virtual functions, why one would want to use them, and more of their intracacies.

# What is in my way
Absolutely need to do homework over the break so right now the family who *scoff* wants to spend time(??) with me. I don't even remember what that means anymore, but if they need me I'll be grading papers, writing a compiler and code-generator, finishing A Tale of Two Cities, deciding on when I'm starting for Microsoft (again so sorry for the wait, recruiter, this is totally my B), studying for OOP, finishing an Android app, and all the other things that I forgot. Oh yeah, and *relaxing*.

# What will you do next week
Turkey.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Don't forget to text your Mom back.

# Appreciation
Remember when we all thought cold weather would be nice? I miss you already Summer.

# Grievances
My roommate's dog Gizmo ate spaghetti on my bed when I left the room, and he definitely didn't eat it in a cute Lady the Tramp way.
