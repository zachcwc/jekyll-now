# Past Week
Had a speaker come in and talk about working at Bloomberg, which was very interesting. I think I saw him working on the sixth floor later that afternoon, which makes me wonder how many people on campus and especially in the GDC at any given time are non-students or faculty. Yet another reason to be glad for the more-lax dress code in the software industry; I can't imagine the horror of resisting sweatpants for fear of a potential recruiter judging me from afar, were I, say, a pre-law or government student. Learned about the equality operator in class as well, c++ allowing developers to override basic operators (I forgot the technical term, sue me) such as ++ and == for types they have defined is extremely cool and fun to learn about.

# What is in my way
Right now, and I expect for far too long, that interview grind is the bane of my life. When I get a job I never want to hear the name Gayle Laakmann agan. That being said, without her interview bible I doubt interviews would go half so smoothly, that being said they are still A+ train wrecks. Also, allergies.

# What will you do next week
Need to schedule flights/interviews, which means I need to figure out exactly which classes I want to lose attendance credit in.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
TBD

# Appreciation
Six dollar coupon on the HEB app for Claritin-d. Together, we will destroy you utterly, ragweed. Also, found free, really good, west-campus parking late Friday night which was 0% expected.

# Grievances
1. Why do allergies suck so much?
2. Let it go L.A. Fitness, we're done. Greg is free.
3. Can you realease the specs on your new phone, Google, so I can make a decision? K thx.

# Note
If I have to listen to one more rendition of 'Roses' or 'Closer' by the Chainsmokers, I swear I will be so annoyed for like two seconds before getting really really into the song and raging along. ~say you'll never let me go *base drop*~
