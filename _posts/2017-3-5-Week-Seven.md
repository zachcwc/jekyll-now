# Past Week
Had SWE test and Advanced Architecture project due. Got together a group for SWE presentation. Went out for Mardi Gras.

# Experience of Class so Far
I suppose that now we are getting to the uphill climb part of the class. So far it's just been relatively easy projects and Python (also not difficult) mastering, but now comes the goliath final project. It will be interesting to see if it's the project that's hard, or whether it is coordinating such a large team. Presumably I should tell of my experience in regards to the first test. Well, it wasn't very difficult, I found it much more difficult that the OOP tests, but that's because the OOP tests didn't really test on the reading as much and more were concerned with writing code.

# What is in my way
Multicore is a neverending battle where no one wins, we just lose in a different place every day. It's interesting how the class is so difficult and time-consuming that you need to find more satisfication in the actual learning than completing the implementation. I believe that as of now about 2/3 of the class is behind in the project by a week or two (I am proud to be at the vanguard ~maybe~ of those who are behind), which is almost hilarious when you consider how in almost every other class these same students would be in the top quartile to say the least. It is quite the learning experience.

# What will you do next week
Advanced architecture hw due Thursday, Security project, test, and hw all due at one point or another, and finally an art history hw.

THE RUMORS ARE TRUE SPOTIFY HOUSE IS NOT COMING FOR SXSW THIS YEAR.
WEEP.
