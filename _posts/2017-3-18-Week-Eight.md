title: Week Eight Software Engineering

# Past Week
Went out every other day, which I think is a great spring break schedule because your body isn't destroyed. And every other day I worked on barrelfish. In Class two weeks ago we talked about the new projects and the requirements in that.

# Experience of Class so Far
We are about to see how difficult this final project really is so that's certainly intimidating. It doesn't seem too bad, but of course nothing does at first. I am excited to learn about the new swathe of technologies you have to learn in order to do the project, the last time I learned a bunch of technologies was in OOP last semester and it was really interesting.

# What is in my way
I mean Multicore during Spring break is just great but also no its absolutely terrible that was a lie. Time constraints are becoming more and more glaringly obvious, but we'll see if I can pull a spring in the last lap of the race or if I crawl past the finish line. What's interesting is that the time conttraints now come not only from school, but from having to move to Seattle. What classes do I need to skip in order to have an apartment, do I need to buy furniture or should I work on this project, etc.

# What will you do next week
Advanced architecture hw due Thursday, OOP project due Thursday, art history test I need to take at some point.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Wear sunscreen.
