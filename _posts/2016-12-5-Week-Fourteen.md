# Past Week
OOP final, Mobile Computing final app due, grading for OS, Brit. Lit Final. Everything but sleep.

# What is in my way
That the human body needs a resting phase in its (semi)daily cycle. Can't wait to pass out for 12 hours straight when finals hell is over.

# What will you do next week
Compilers all day errday, grade the OS final - which just sounds peachy -, and hopefully hour of code. When that's over read some books, redo PintOS for funsies, workout, and that new Harry Potter movie for sure.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
I know it's kind of late, but don't procrastinate.

# Appreciation
It's almost over.

# Grievances
Getting kind of nervous that the recruiter for Microsoft hasn't responded to my email in a few days. I'm already hired so it's not an unduly amount of nerve-wracking, but it would be nice to have the same level of prompness that I experienced when I was applying. I'm sure it's just an off-week for them or something (so I am telling myself).

# Class experience
I liked OOP. Some of the object-oriented stuff finally started becoming more prevalent at the end, so one needs to come into the class knowing that it's only during the latter half of the course that you (or at least that I) will start to see the connections between things and realize how the puzzle pieces fit together in an object-oriented way. I am very very glad we were able to become more familiar with all the tools we use, and I know that interviewers were very happy that I had at least a base knowledge of some testing framework (GTest), a condel tool (Travis). and more than anything Docker.
