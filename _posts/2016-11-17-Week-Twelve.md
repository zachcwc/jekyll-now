# Past Week
Finishing Life as we speak, so many tests, so little time. Also starting to grade VM for Operating Systems and some drunk lady rear-ending me. Pretty fun week.

# What is in my way
There is not enough time in the day. It's awful when you get the point of having to choose something to give up, solely because no matter what you do there isn't enough time to do it all. I picked working out so that sucks, but I'm sure I can get hella swole during Thanksgiving break (yeah, right).

# What will you do next week
Honestly mostly catch up on all my classes, projects all day errday. Sorry family, move aside, I gots a Dickens novel to read. HA nah probably just World of Warcraft and worrying about stuff in that previous sentence.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Don't drive drunk, it's so dumb and so easy not to do (relative to the consquences incurred).

# Appreciation
Chipotle, everyday. Also, surprisingly, car insurance. But not car-insurance agents, those suck.

# Grievances
It's so annoying how like one day you can have coffee at six and be totally fine to fall asleep by a reasonable hour and then on another day you can finish all of your coffee by four PM and be up until four AM, like, can you provide me with consistency body? Clients love consistency and you're really screwing me over here. Also kind of annoyed at it being fall but still feeling summer. Do we not get a fall this year? Plz Texas, it's too hot.
