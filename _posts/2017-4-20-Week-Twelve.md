title: Week Twelve Software Engineering
---

# Past Week
Implemented message passing between cores in multicore, learned about the strategy pattern in SWE, implemented AES-256 in security, learned about Middle Eastern art in art history, and wrote a 4bit alu for advanced architecture.

# Experience of Class so Far
Learning about the strategy pattern these last couple of days has been very interesting, I feel like using these design patterns well is one of the things that differentiate mediocre software engineers from good software engineers. Also fun has been the final part of the IDB project. It is definitely less difficult than the second part, so there's actually time to enjoy what you're doing instead of just dreading an impending deadline. I am doing the data visualization and there are so so so many tutorials for d3 online and it makes it definitely doable.

# What is in my way
My squat form is sub-par and now my back hurts.

# What will you do next week
Finish SWE project, start multicore project, start architecture project, art history test, start security project, grade design documents for 439.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Pay attention to tutorial version numbers because they could be using a deprectated version of a tool, and you probably shouldn't use that tutorial as a strict guide.
