# Past Week
Frantically finished Collatz. Interestingly, the project itself took like an hour to finish, but checking that all of the specs were correct took ~5 hours and I'm still pretty sure that they are wrong. We did crazy pointer and address stuff in class that made my head hurt, but, surprisingly, looks super interesting.

# What is in my way
I probably didn't need to check that I had named all my files correctly 23432423 times, but hey at least now I have complete (50%) certainty that I actually did name them all correctly. AND WAIT NOW I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN I ADDED AN EXTRA FILE (Doxyfile) to my github account. All is lost.

# What will you do next week
Maybe not freak out as much as this week? Soft maybe.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
OMG git has an --amend flag where you can amend the last commit you made THIS IS AMAZING. So like you add blerg and commit and then you're like dangit I forgot to add hurgh now I have to make another commit like two seconds after the first. WELL GET IT TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU DON'T. You just make your change and then $ git --amend and BAM ur done. You can also change the commit message if you include the -m flag but if not it will just keep the old one. I feel reborn.

# Appreciation
Had Mexican food and Ramen twice in one week. Bless up.

# Grievances
This semester I am a TA for CS 439 (Norman). So I was having my first office hours of the semester and they were mostly great; they learned a bunch, I learned a bunch. But, in what world do you just plop down your laptop in front of a professor/TA with no preamble, with nothing on your screen except some output string, and say: "What's wrong with this"? I have no idea, it looks like you're failing a test, is that the answer you were looking for because that's really all I have to work on. You have files and files of code, you've been working on this implementation for hours or days, and you really think that I can just sixth sense your error without any background knowledge whatsoever? Like, gimme a bone here, I really do want to help.
