# Past Week
Presentations in SWE. I think ours went well, and I loved the one of the team that went after us (one on art, I forget the name), but the website was designed beautifully.

# Experience of Class so Far
The finish line is in sight, two days away to be exact. I am nervous for this test. I always did well on the OOP coding ones, but I didn't do so hot on the SWE multiple choice. If I get a ninety on this I have a chance at an A in the class and that would be swell, but that being said if I do poorly on the final at least I don't have to worry about failing the class, unless I do really really just awful

# What is in my way
This week has been rough for everyone as it is every semester, but for me specifically, allergies have been the most annoying part.

# What will you do next week
SWE test, security test, multicore turn-in and defense paper, advanced architecture simulator finishing (almost done!!).

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Allergy medicine is so important to have on hand for those times when you're just too busy to get some from the store. Going through finals/pre-finals week with allergies or sickness of any kind is just horrible. Also do the readings one more time before the test, you will understand them much more the second time around.
