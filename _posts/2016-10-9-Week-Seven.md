# Past Week
Tests everywhere.

# What is in my way
Right now having to skip attendance based classes because of interviews feels like it's in my way. Also it took me three commits before I got this post's title right. why.

# What will you do next week
Interviews and projects.

# Tips and Miscellaneous Advice/Drivel
Treat yo' self.

# Decisions
What do you do when you are flown to X city for an interview? Do you explore the city? Do you party it up downtown? Make a friend in a day? See an art museum or maybe a play or maybe a really cool monument that you've seen in pictures but not in real life? Probably not, you probably study. Hopefully you go to a neighborhood coffeeshop or library to study and don't just stay in your hotel room, but either way you sit in one spot in a mysterious and exciting new city you may never visit again, and you reread tabbed parts of Gayle Laakmann's book, and you look at leetcode. Should we do that? It feels wrong, but so does not studying. I mean the entire point of you visiting this city is so that you can get a job, do you really want to (maybe) impact your chances of getting the job after coming so far? Do I? I have no idea.
